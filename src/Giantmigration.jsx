                            <p>Giant Migration, even though an extraordinarily resourceful company, lacked the opportunity of visibility. As a comparatively new immigration company, Giant Migration needed digital marketing to maximise their digital visibility so that they could reach to potential clients. </p>

                                <p>Our main strategy was to create a marketing roadmap that would establish them as a professional, reputable, and credible brand. To accomplish these results, we worked on increasing brand awareness, conversions and unique lead generation across all major social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc. and obviously on the search engine Mecca, Google. At the same time, we were also focused on maintaining the consistency of the brand to further increase the credibility of the brand and strengthen our outcome. </p>

                                            <p>Good SEO strategy is the foundation to any website. We had a challenge of building authority as it was a comparatively newer website in an already edgy market. It was critical that we focus on quantity rather than quantity and that is why we have been able to drive significant organic traffic to the website. With regular monitoring and continuous SEO activities, we were able to bring the website in top 10 results on Google. </p>

Right from keeping the customer informed to keeping them engaged, we covered everything. </p>

All of this cumulatively expanded the client base, increased monthly client flow, significant increase in monthly leads and overall business expansion. </p>
